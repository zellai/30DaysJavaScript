// Exercise: level 1
// 1. Get user input using prompt(“Enter your age:”). If user is 18 or older , give feedback:'You are old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to wait for the number of years he needs to turn 18.

// let age = prompt("Enter your age")
// let underage = 18 - (+age)
// if (age >= 18 ){
//     alert('You are old enought to drive.')
// }else {
//     alert(`Your are left with ${underage} years to drive`)
// }

//  2. Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(“Enter your age:”) to get the age as input.

// let yourAge = prompt("Enter your age:"),
//     myAge = 25,
//     older = yourAge - myAge,
//     younger = myAge - yourAge


// if (yourAge > myAge){
//     alert(`You are ${older} years older than me`)
// }else {
//     alert(`You are ${younger} years younger than me`)
// }

// 3. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways

// let a = 4
// let b = 3

// if (a > b){
//     console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`)
// }else {
//     console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`)
// }

// 4. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?

// let num = prompt("Enter number: ")
// if(num % 2 == 0){
//     alert(`${num} is an even number`)
// }else{
//     alert(`${num} is an odd number`)
// }
